# ðŸ˜· Dark Kitchen

> Dark kitchens are also known as virtual kitchens, cloud kitchens, ghost kitchens or delivery-only restaurants. However you call it, a dark kitchen always revolves around the same concept: selling meals exclusively through delivery. Ghost kitchens have no sitting capacity for in-house diners or walk-ins, as they focus only on delivery, preparing food once an order comes in through a delivery app or an online ordering system.


- Type of challenge: `consolidation`  
- Duration: `3 days`  
- Team challenge: `teams of 2-3`
- Deployment strategy: `Github Pages or Netlify`

## Learning objectives

Using all that you know about frontend so far to work on real use case.

## The mission

You will be in charge of building a Dark Kitchen online delivery service. The site must be with the following features.

(ðŸŒ± = Must Have | ðŸŒ¼ = Nice To Have)

- ðŸŒ± Create a list of dishes that people will order online.
- ðŸŒ± The website should be responsive, it should work on a standard mobile resolution and on desktop
- ðŸŒ± You must list the food using some sort of card templates
- ðŸŒ± You should categorize your food to be able to filter it (ex: vegan, comfort food)
- ðŸŒ± You should create a `shopping cart` component to display the selected dishes with their price and the amount ordered and an "order" button
  - ðŸŒ± Your items must still be saved after reloading a page. (tip: see `localStorage`)
- If the user clicks on order, the following should happen:
  - ðŸŒ¼ a `modal` should appear asking for their **name**, **email**, **region**, **city**, **zip**, **street** and **street number** and save it in a local storage
  - ðŸŒ¼ after submitting the modal form, it goes to a page with the final order containing all details (the order + delivery address + contact information)
  - ðŸŒ¼ include a delivery and VAT fee to the total price
- ðŸŒ± You should create a `dark mode` switch, to toggle your design between a `light` and a `dark` mode
